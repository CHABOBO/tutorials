To construct the solver all that is needed is the inverse temperature $\\beta$ and a list that describes the block structure of the Green's function. This is the `gf_struct` keyword. In this specific case, there are two blocks `up` and `down` and each only have one index 0. This is what is described by `gf_struct`.\n",
