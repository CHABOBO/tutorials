    "\n",
    "In general it is a good idea to develop the script in the notebook, because it is very convenient to find bugs and to quickly come to a working code. In the beginning you should use a small number of Monte Carlo iterations (say 1000) so that the script runs quickly. Your first main goal is to have a functional script. However, once the script is done, I recommend that you do longer runs (production runs) from a shell. It will be easier for you to see the progress of the Monte Carlo solver. Think about saving the relevant data to an archive and then go back to the notebook when it comes to analyzing, plotting the results. This is usually how things are done: elaboration of the scripts and analysis of the data from the notebook, production from a shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run your script from a shell, open a terminal and go in the tutorial directory.\n",
    "This is where you should edit your production script. Let's call it `run_dmft.py`. Use `vi` or `gedit` to create\n",

    "\n",
    "`>>> pytriqs run_dmft.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! When the run is done and data has been saved into an archive, you can go back to the notebook and read the archive in order to analyze or plot the results."
